Possible things I might do, when I feel for it.
Writing them down before I forget them again....
Text files do not go into the html-file if you uses tweego

- Updating help, new items, perhaps a FAQ for things nagged about in the f85 forum

- Changing automation rules, having new goood ideas how to make better, perhaps less overlappping between the rules

- extending exploring events etc., more actions/options in one event
-- example: having a doctor among your companions gives more options 

Any suggestions? Feel free to add!
