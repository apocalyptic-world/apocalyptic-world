Hey! You busy? I have a favor to ask. I've got some goods I need to deliver somewhere, but I don't have time. Could you?
<br />
It won't be for free of course. I'll pay you in advance out of my client's prepayment. Just be careful, you'll need to go to the nearby underground city. That place doesn't have the best reputation - for good reason.
