<strong>WHERE IS SHE OLD MAN?!</strong>
<br />
<br />
Vincent drops on his knees and begs to them
<br /><br />

<<vincent>>I don't know. I don't! She run away as I've said before<</vincent>>
<br />
Guys checks each door but fail to find Blair and soon enough they're all gone. <br />
Vincent turns toward you as Blair comes out of some hidden room. 
<br /><br />
<<vincent>>
	We can't take it anymore. This was way too close. I have a favor to ask. Could she sleep at your place? Only sleep, in the mornings, she will be gone as I need her help here.<br />
Please!<br />
Your place would be perfect as I don't even know where you live.<br />
I beg you!. Nights are most unsecure as we won't see them coming.
