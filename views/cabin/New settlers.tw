Their faces soften with a mixture of relief and gratitude. <<=setup.displayName(_npc1)>> nods quickly, reaching for your hand with a grip that speaks of survival, 
of a person ready to build a life from the ground up, no matter how hard it may be.

You lead them down the worn path through the heart of the settlement, the dirt packed hard from footsteps. 
The air feels a little warmer here, sheltered from the cold and open wilds beyond the walls, and they relaxes just a fraction as they realize they've made it. 
<<=setup.displayName(_npc1)>> looks at <<=setup.displayName(_npc2)>> with a smile on <<=setup.pronounceWho(_npc1)>> face.

Finally, you arrive at one of the empty houses. The roof, though patched in places, holds strong, and the door swings open with a soft creak. 
Dust hangs in the air, disturbed as they step inside, and though the place is bare, it's shelterâ€”a gift of unimaginable value in these times.
