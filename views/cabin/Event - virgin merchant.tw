As you step out of the wood cabin, the chill of air stings your cheeks. 
The world beyond the settlement gates is a mix of desolation and stubborn life, struggling to survive amidst ruins and overgrown vegetation. 
The sound that catches your attention isn't the usual rustle of leaves or distant animal calls; it's a voice, human and unexpected.

Walking towards the gates, you saw himâ€”a weathered old man with a tattered cloak and a cart laden with goods. His eyes, though tired, 
gleamed with a sharp intelligence that belied his age. He introduced himself as a merchant, his voice carrying a hint of gravel from years spent on the road.
<br /><br />
Then came his chilling request, delivered with a casualness that made your blood run cold.

	Looking into his eyes, you find an old, rusted pipe within arm's reach, and you strike him in the head with it. He wasn't prepared for it and falls dead to the ground. Within seconds, the ground around him turns red.

	<strong>People like him will leave you alone for a while.</strong>
