As you descended into the dank basement, the <<=setup.displayName(_mistress)>>'s chilling presence hung heavy in the air, casting long shadows across the stone walls. 
<<=setup.pronounceWho(_mistress, true)>> piercing gaze met yours as you approached.
<br /><br />
<<sayNpc _mistress>>
    I have an idea. A way to tighten our grip on these wretched souls.
<</sayNpc>>
<br />
You braced yourself for what was to come, knowing all too well the depths of her depravity.
<br /><br />
<<you>>
    Go on
<</you>>
<br />
<<sayNpc _mistress>>
    We shall host a feast. A celebration of their submission, a testament to our absolute control.
<</sayNpc>>
<br />
Your stomach churned at the thought, but you dared not show weakness in the presence of such malevolence.
<br /><br />
<<you>>
    And what purpose will this serve?
<</you>>
<br />
<<=setup.pronounceWho(_mistress, true)>> laughter echoed off the walls, a discordant symphony of madness and malice.
<br /><br />
<<sayNpc _mistress>>
    To break them or to make them more happy?... Your choice.
<</sayNpc>>
<br />
You swallowed hard, the bitter taste of fear coating your tongue like poison.

        Please sir! We would do anything for a decent meal and something outside these cages.

    As you turned to leave, the Mistress's laughter followed you like a ghostly specter, a haunting reminder of the darkness that dwelled within us all. 
    And in the depths of that desolate basement, where shadows danced with the echoes of suffering, you knew that the true horrors had only just begun.
