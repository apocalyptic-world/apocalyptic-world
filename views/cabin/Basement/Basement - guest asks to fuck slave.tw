<<set _guest = $guests[$tmpEvent.guestId]>>
<<set _slave = $slaves[$tmpEvent.slaveId]>>

A soft shuffle catches your attention, and you turn to see <<=setup.displayName(_guest)>>, one of your guests, peering cautiously around the corner. 
His eyes fixated on <<=setup.displayName(_slave)>>. There's hunger and longing in his gaze, tinged with desperation that mirrors the bleakness of your existence.

When he finally notices you, his body jolts in surprise, and his request hangs heavy in the air.
You study his face, the lines of exhaustion etched deep into his skin, the fear and uncertainty in his eyes. 
The post-apocalyptic world has stripped you of many things, but it seems some desires remain untouched by the ravages of time.

    Sorry, <<=$player.name>>...

<<sayNpc _guest>>
    It's just... it's been so long since...
<</sayNpc>>
<br />
His words trail off, lost in the abyss of unspoken yearning.

<<sayNpc _guest>>
    Maybe I can have sex with her? Just once.

    <br /><br />
    As <<=setup.displayName(_guest)>> nods silently, retreating into the shadows of the basement, you can't help but wonder how much of your humanity you have already sacrificed in the name of survival. 
    The line between right and wrong blurs in the harsh light of a world that has crumbled, leaving you to pick up the shattered pieces of your existence.
