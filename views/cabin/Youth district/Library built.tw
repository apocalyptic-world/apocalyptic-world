:: Library built [Place]
<h1 class="ptitle">LIBRARY</h1>

Weathered shelves line the walls, their surfaces adorned with an eclectic array of volumes salvaged from abandoned buildings and scavenged from the remnants of civilization. 
Tattered pages whisper tales of forgotten worlds, their words a testament to the resilience of human ingenuity in the face of adversity.
