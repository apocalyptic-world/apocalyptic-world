You wandered toward the Youth District.
<br />
You weren’t heading there for any real reason — just walking, thinking, watching how your people moved now.
<br /><br />
That’s when you spotted <<=setup.displayName(_npc)>>
<br /><br />
She stood in the middle of the open plaza, a worn book in her hand, speaking to a small group of people. 
Her voice, calm but firm, carried above the low buzz of the district — something about circuits and stored energy, using a broken-down radio as a teaching prop.

<br /><br />
She wasn’t dressed like a fighter today. Just a faded sundress, patched and faded, her <<=_npc.hair>> hair tied back. 
You watched for a moment, leaning against a post as the people asked questions. 
She explained patiently, her tone never condescending, always pulling them in. Some of the younger poeple looked like they were really listening — which said a lot.
<br /><br />
When the impromptu class ended and the group started to scatter, you made you continued with your way.
<br /><br />
<<if setup.percentageChance(30)>>
    <<set _talked = true>>
    <<=setup.displayName(_npc)>> saw you and smirked.
    <br /><br />
    <<sayNpc _npc>>
        Didn’t expect to see you out here. Hope you don't mind.
    <</sayNpc>>
    She tapped the book against her palm.
    <br /><br />
    <<sayNpc _npc>>
        We need to start building minds again, not just bunkers. I was thinking — what if we actually made a school?
    <</sayNpc>>
    <br />
    <<sayNpc _npc>>
        Not just this — not just me talking in the heat. A real space. Please.
    <</sayNpc>>
    <br />
    You looked at her. Not like a dreamer. Like someone making plans.
    <br /><br />
    <<sayNpc _npc>>
        You really want me to beg?
    <</sayNpc>>
    <br />
    Then, as if catching herself, she looked away — lips pressed tight, the heat of the afternoon suddenly heavier between you both.
    <br /><br />
    Then without another word, <<=setup.displayName(_npc)>> grabbed your wrist—firm, urgent—and pulled you behind the nearest crumbling outbuilding. 
    <br /><br />
    She glanced around, not for fear of being seen, but more like she was bracing herself. Then she pulled her skirt up just above her hip, revealing her naked ass.

    Before you could respond, she positioned herself, her legs spreading wide as she prepared to sit on your cock. 
    She guided you to her entrance, her eyes locked on yours, a look of pure lust and desire in her gaze. 
    <br /><br />

    <br /><br />
    <<=setup.displayName(_npc)>>'s movements were slow and deliberate at first, but as she grew more comfortable, she began to move faster, her hips grinding against yours as she took you deeper and deeper.
    <br /><br />
    Taking the lead, you began to fuck her with long, deep strokes, your hips moving in a relentless rhythm. You could feel every inch of her, her tightness gripping you, milking you with each movement.
    <br /><br />
    <<image 'places/school/teacher3.webp'>>
    <br /><br />
    With a final, deep thrust, you came undone, your hot cum shooting into her, filling her completely. 
    <<=setup.displayName(_npc)>> let out a loud cry of pleasure, her body convulsing as she reached her own climax, her walls clenching around your cock, milking every last drop of your release.

        I hope I earned that school.
