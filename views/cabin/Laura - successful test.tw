Finally, one day, as you go about your daily tasks within your village, you notice a figure standing at the gate. Your heart skips a beat when you recognize Dr. Finch, her lab coat still bearing traces of the chemicals she's been working with. She holds a small paper in her hand.

	You bastard! You wasn't lying! Tests came back positive! 
	Can we talk? We need to talk!
<</laura>>

<<linkreplace 'Invite her in'>>
	As you approach the gates, you reach out to a rusted lever, a makeshift mechanism for opening and closing the entrance. With a firm pull, the gates creak open, revealing the bustling life within the village. The moment the gates start to move, you notice Dr. Finch's eyes widening in amazement.

	As you both step inside, Dr. Finch takes in the sights and sounds of your village. She gazes at the resourceful architecture, the communal gardens, and the people going about their daily tasks. It's a place built on determination and cooperation, a sanctuary in the midst of chaos.

		Did you build all of this?

			I'm truly impressed with what you've built here,
		<</laura>>
		<br />
		<<laura>>
			But there's something important we need to discuss regarding the sperm test results. It's a matter that requires discretion.
		<</laura>>
		<br /><br />
		<<linkreplace 'Go to your bedroom'>>
			Dr. Finch nods in agreement, understanding the importance of discretion in your conversation. Together, you make your way to your bedroom, a small but cozy space where you can speak freely without the risk of eavesdropping.

				While analyzing the test results I also discovered something fascinating related to the growth potion. It appears that your genetic makeup has a unique compatibility with the enzyme we need for the potion's development.
			<</laura>>
			<br /><br />
			<<laura>>
				The possibilities are truly unlimited. With your unique genetic compatibility, we could create a potion that not only accelerates the growth of crops, producing larger and more bountiful harvests to help feed our community, but it could also be used for human applications.
			<</laura>>
			<br /><br />
			<<laura>>
				Imagine a potion that allows humans to age faster, reaching physical maturity and peak condition in a matter of days rather than years.
				<br />
				But there's one more thing... I first need to make more tests and I am out of samples. I need them to continue my work. Can you help me with that?

						Eh, as much as I wouldn't like that. I really want those samples as they could benefit the world so much.

						I have better idea. Take your pants off. I'll do it myself so we don't waste any of your samples.

				You pull down your pants and lay down on your bed. Before she starts she takes out gloves and puts them on with smile on her face. She gazes at your balls in amazement.

				She firmly grabs your dick and slowly starts to jerk it off while still not taking eyes off your balls.

					If you don't hurry, this will take us the whole day.

				She significantly speeds up her hand movements and starts squeezing your balls with her other hand.

					Before you cum she puts another sample cup in front of your dick and collects all cum you shoot out.

						Perfect! I can continue my research. I'll be back after few days with results.
