After the heartfelt ceremony in the greenhouse, the small group of survivors moved to the kitchen, which had been transformed into an intimate gathering space. The dim lighting created a cozy atmosphere, and the flickering candlelight added a touch of warmth to the cold surroundings.
<br /><br />
The bride's father bid his daughter a tearful farewell, his eyes filled with a mix of joy and longing. With a heavy heart, he departed, leaving the bride in the care of her newfound friends. The girls formed a protective circle around her, their presence a reminder that they were all in this together, navigating the desolate world with strength and resilience.
<br /><br />
Laughter and whispers filled the air as the girls embraced the bride, enveloping her in a sisterhood forged through shared experiences. They had all faced loss and hardship, but this night was a chance to revel in the love and joy that had been found amidst the ruins.

How about our wedding night? I will go freshen up, but after 10 minutes, I'll be waiting for you in the room

<br /><br />
Blair left, and the girls bid her good night with giggles on their faces, knowing what would unfold in that room.

				You grab her head and push your dick as far as you can inside her mouth as she gags but still tries to take it all.
