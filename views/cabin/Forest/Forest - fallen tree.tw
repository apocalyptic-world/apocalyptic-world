The dim light of dawn filters through the makeshift windows of your camp as you go over the daily plans with your small team. 
The air carries a slight chill, a reminder of the ever-present uncertainty of this new world. Suddenly, the sound of hurried footsteps echoes through the camp. 
You look up to see one of the forest workers, sweat dripping from his brow and eyes wide with panic, rushing toward you.
<br /><br />
<<sayNpc _npc>>
    You gotta come quick! It's <<=setup.displayName(_victim)>>! <<=_pronWhat>>'s been crushed by a tree! _pronWhat's stuck and we can't get <<=_pronWho>> out!
<</sayNpc>>
<br />
The <<=setup.displayName(_npc)>> leads you through the thick underbrush, past the remnants of a once-thriving forest now scarred by the apocalypse. 
Your mind races with possible scenarios and solutions. You need to assess the situation quickly and act even faster.

<br /><br />
You reach the site, and there lies <<=setup.displayName(_victim)>>, trapped beneath a massive fallen tree. <<=_pronWhat>>'s conscious but in visible pain, <<=setup.pronounceWhos(_victim)>> chest pinned awkwardly under the heavy trunk. 
The other workers are gathered around, their faces etched with concern and helplessness.
<br /><br />
<<sayNpc _npc>>
    If we have enough axes we can try to get <<=_pronWho>> out!

            <<run setup.cabinInventory.drop('axe', 5)>>
            <<run $('#option_look').hide()>>
            Your team members scramble to grab their tools. 
            The air is thick with urgency as you race back to the site where <<=setup.displayName(_victim)>> lies pinned beneath the massive tree. 
            <<=setup.pronounceWhos(_victim, true)>> face is pale, sweat beading on <<=setup.pronounceWhos(_victim)>> forehead, but <<=setup.pronounceWhat(_victim)>>'s still conscious.
            <br /><br />
            <<addmins 30>>
            Finally, with a mighty crack, the tree splits. 
            <br /><br />
            <strong class="iitem">You broke 5 axes</strong>

                Everyone, lift!
            <</you>>
            <br />
            Together, you and the team heave, using every bit of strength to shift the massive trunk just enough to free <<=setup.displayName(_victim)>>.
            <br />
            You rush <<=_pronWhat>> back to the camp with broken bones.
            <<set _victim.sick = {

        <<run $('#option_help').hide()>>
        <<=setup.displayName(_victim)>>'s breathing becomes more labored, and you notice <<=setup.pronounceWhos(_victim)>> grip on your hand weakening. Panic starts to seep into your determination.
        <br /><br />
        <<you>>
            <<=setup.displayName(_victim)>>, no! Hold on!
        <</you>>
        <br />
        You shout, but it's too late. <<=setup.pronounceWhos(_victim, true)>> eyes close, <<=setup.pronounceWhos(_victim)>> chest rises and falls one last time, and then <<=_pronWhat>>'s gone.
        <<guestRemove _randomPeople[0]>>
        <br /><br />
        A heavy silence falls over the group. The sound of axes stops as everyone realizes the horrifying truth. <<=setup.displayName(_victim)>> is dead.
