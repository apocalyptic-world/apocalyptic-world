:: Negan - fuel slaves
<h1 class="ptitle">NEGAN'S OFFICE</h1>
<br />
Negan, seated at his makeshift desk, looks up as the newcomers enter. 
His keen eyes assess the group, noting their worn-out clothes and exhaustion.
<br />
<br />
<<set _girls = setup.neganQuest2HaveGirls()>>
<<set _npc1 = setup.companionGet(_girls[0])>>
<<set _npc2 = setup.companionGet(_girls[1])>>
<<set _npc3 = setup.companionGet(_girls[2])>>
<<set _npc4 = setup.companionGet(_girls[3])>>
<<negan>>
    Oh, what we got here.
<</negan>>
<br /><br />
Negan rises from his chair. He keenly observes each girl, gauging their demeanor and intentions in this unforgiving world.<br />
After that he goes back to his desk, opens drawer and takes out ropes and rope gags. Goes back to the girls and starts to tie them up.

As Negan finishes to tie them, he calls for a guards outside and they come in and takes them away. After that Negan turns to you.

    It looks like this could be the beginning of a nice friendship.
