:: Weather - Heat wave
<h1 class="ptitle"><<=$game.cabinName ?? ''>></h1>
<br /><br />
You awaken to an eerie red glow seeping through the cracks in the wooden walls of your cabin. 
The usual gray of the morning sky has been replaced by a vivid, unsettling crimson. 
A sense of foreboding fills you as you rise from your bed and move to the door. As soon as you open it, a blast of oppressive heat slams into your face, nearly knocking you back.

<<set _randomGuestId = setup.getRandomPersons(_randomGuestIds[0] ?? _randomGuestIds[1], 1)>>
<<set _npc = $guests[_randomGuestId[0]]>>
<br />
Squinting against the harsh light, you step outside and see <<=setup.displayName(_npc)>>, one of your settlers, rushing toward you. 
Sweat drips down their forehead, and their face is flushed with the intense heat.

        Heat wave... Again... I don't know if some of us will get through it this time...

    <<sayNpc _npc>>
        It's a heat wave. I've never seen anything like it. The sky turned red just before dawn.

    <<you>>
        A heat wave? How long is it supposed to last?

        From what the old folks are saying, it could be a few days. Maybe more. This isnâ€™t like the usual heat, though. It happens every few months.

<<sayNpc _npc>>
    The crops in the garden are already starting to wilt.
<</sayNpc>>
<br />
The next few days will be a grueling test of endurance and resourcefulness. The heat is relentless, and the air shimmers with an oppressive intensity.
<br /><br />
<strong class="iitem">
    Your crops won't grow for the period of the heat wave and produce any food.
