:: Outside - safe haven
<h1 class="ptitle">OUTSIDE</h1>
<br /><br />
The air is still as you step beyond the reinforced gates of the settlement. 
The usual rustle of wind through the broken remnants of the old world carries something else—a faint, haunting sound. 
You pause, listening. A cry. Thin, wavering, undeniably human.
<br /><br />
At first, you think it might be a trap—bandits often use such tricks to lure the unsuspecting—but something in the sound tugs at your instincts. Blade in hand, you move cautiously toward the source. 
As you approach, you see it: a small figure.

<br /><br />
A child, barely more than a few weeks old, wrapped in a tattered, patchwork blanket.
<br /><br />
You freeze, scanning the area. A parent? A threat? The wasteland teaches you to be careful, and yet, there’s nothing but silence. The child’s cries grow louder, his tiny hands flailing weakly in the cold, unforgiving air.
<br /><br />
You crouch down, your shadow falling over the child. His cries falter for a moment, and his wide, innocent eyes lock onto yours. For a moment, you see your reflection in those eyes—not the hardened survivor the wasteland has made you, but the person you once were, long ago.

</strong>
<br />
The cries grow softer now, almost pleading, as if the child senses the weight of your decision. What will you do?

        The child’s cries grow quieter as you stand there, motionless, the weight of the decision pressing down on you. 
        You look at the settlement behind you, its gates closed tight, a reminder of the hard life you’ve fought to protect. Inside, resources are stretched thin, and every new mouth to feed is a risk—not just to yourself, but to everyone who calls that place home.
        <br /><br />
        You glance back at the child, bundled in scraps, her tiny fingers grasping at the air. 
        Her wide eyes seem to plead with you, searching for comfort, safety, or hope. But out here, hope is a luxury you stopped believing in long ago.
