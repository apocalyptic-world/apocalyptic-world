Walking through the dark city, suddenly around the corner you hear a strange but familiar sound. You decide to see what it is, and you see that little children are playing with a ball in a partially lit square.
<br /><br />
One of the children runs up to you and asks if you have anything to eat and if you could give them something to snack on.
