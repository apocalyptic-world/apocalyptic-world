It's a slum as soon as you turn away from main street. Half dead Junkies lying on the ground, sluts fucking in each corner for a little bit of caps; even a few guys are beating up someone in the alley.<br />
You continue until something causes you stop in the dark streets - a wanted poster. And shockingly to you, something about it seems familiar...<br /><br />

Wow, you could definitely use that kind of a money. But that's Vincent...he's an alright guy and a fair merchant, even if he seems to have an annoying habit of holding you at gunpoint.<br />
