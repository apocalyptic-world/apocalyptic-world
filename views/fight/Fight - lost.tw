You wake up after some time.<br />
You feel dizzy and blood is all over your face and clothes. You were knocked out pretty hard.

			Your heart dropped when you saw her â€” <<=setup.displayName(_fightAlly)>> pinned to the ground by one of them, a man snarling as he tried to force himself on her. He has already pulled down her panties as she screams.
			Moment later he manages to pull down her panties while you still can't get up from lost fight.
			<br />
			You notice him getting his dick out as you try to get up but without success. 
			<br /><br />

			<br /><br />
			His butt tensed up before she with big thrust shoved his dick in <<=setup.displayName(_fightAlly)>>. She let out load scream and begged him to stop but with no use. 
			As her head was pinned down to the ground the only thing she did was cry. Nothing else she could do at that moment anymore.
			<br />
			Few more minutes and he released her as he stood up while she still was on the ground crying her eyes out.
