:: Random event - The Strangers by the Fire
<h1 class="ptitle">OUTSIDE</h1>
<br /><br />
When you reached the edge of a town, you saw it: a faint flicker of light cutting through the darkness. A fire.
You moved closer, careful, your boots crunching over broken glass.

<br />
Inside an old diner — half-collapsed, windows shattered — two figures sat beside a barrel fire. 
The glow danced across the walls, painting them in shades of gold and shadow. The man looked up first, his hand moving instantly to a knife.
<br /><br />
<<newguy>>
<<newgirl>>
<<set $tmpGirl.birthDate = setup.getBirthDate(randomInteger(18, 19))>>
<<set $tmpGirl.race = 'white'>>
<<set $tmpGuy.birthDate = setup.getBirthDate(randomInteger(25, 32))>>
<<set $tmpGuy.race = 'white'>>
<<set $tmpGirl.family = {
	siblings: [$tmpGuy.id],

<<set $tmpGuy.family = {
	siblings: [$tmpGirl.id],

<<set $tmpGuy.inventory = {
    knife: 1

<<set $tmpGirl.inventory = {
    knife: 1

<<sayNpc $tmpGuy>>
    That’s close enough
<</sayNpc>>

<br />
He looked about thirty — strong, unshaven, his face lined from too many sleepless nights. His coat was patched and his stance tense, like someone who had spent too long in the crosshairs of danger.
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Beside him sat a girl, maybe seventeen. Her hair was tied in a loose braid, her knife gripped tightly though her hands shook slightly. 
They looked alike — brother and sister — both carrying the same gray eyes that had seen too much loss.
<br /><br />
<<sayNpc $tmpGuy>>
    You alone?
<</sayNpc>>
<br />
Before you could answer, the girl spoke quietly.
<br /><br />
<<sayNpc $tmpGirl>>
    <<=$tmpGuy.name>>, he doesn’t look like a raider
<</sayNpc>>
<br />
You noticed small details that told their story...
<br /><br />
- Photo lay near their packs — two adults and these same siblings smiling, long ago. Someone had drawn an X through the parents’ faces.
<br />
- A folded map rested beside the fire, marked with circles and lines. They had been traveling for a long time.
<br /><br />
The night wind sighed through the diner’s broken walls. You had a choice to make.

        <<you>>
            Easy. I wasn’t looking for trouble
        <</you>>
        <br />
        <<=$tmpGuy.name>>'s eyes studied you for a long moment before he finally lowered his knife.
        <br /><br />
        She told you about the road they had taken — the flooded valleys in the south, the rumors of a safe zone to the north called <<= $game.cabinName ?? 'Heaven'>>. 
        <br />
        <<=$tmpGuy.name>> said little, but his silence spoke of pain and weariness.
        <br /><br />
        <<if $game.cabinName>>
            <<you>>

            <</you>>
            <br />
            <<=$tmpGuy.name>>'s eyes snapped up. His hand tightened on his knife, though not in threat — more in disbelief.
            <br /><br />
            <<sayNpc $tmpGuy>>
                You’re from <<= $game.cabinName>>?
            <</sayNpc>>
            <br />
            You nodded.

                        We’ve been running too long. If what you’re saying is true… maybe it’s time we stopped.

                    <br /><br />
                    They exchanged uncertain looks. Finally, the brother nodded.
