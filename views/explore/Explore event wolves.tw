<h1 class="ptitle">CITY</h1>
<br /><br />
As you roamed through the desolate ruins of the city, its once vibrant streets now reduced to debris and decay, a chilling silence hung heavy in the air. 
<br />
Every step echoed, reminding you of the world that was lost. Amidst the broken buildings and crumbling structures, you became acutely aware of your solitude.
<br /><br />
But then, a distant howl pierced through the stillness. It was haunting, yet strangely alluring. You turned your gaze towards the source of the sound and saw a pack of wolves emerge from the shadows, their eyes gleaming with a fierce hunger. They moved gracefully, their presence a stark reminder of the tenacity of life in this barren wasteland.

<br /><br />
For a moment, time stood still as you locked eyes, neither predator nor prey. There was a primal understanding between you, an unspoken acknowledgment of survival in a world stripped bare.

		But your bravado was short-lived. The wolves, sensing my aggression, quickly circled and closed in on me with a ferocity that left me paralyzed with fear. Their fangs gleamed under the pale sunlight, and their eyes burned with an intensity that matched their predatory instincts.
		<br /><br />
		With a swift and coordinated attack, they lunged at me, tearing through my feeble defenses.
		
		They left you bleeding in the middle of the streets...
