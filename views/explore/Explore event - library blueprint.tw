<h1 class="ptitle">CITY</h1>
<br />
As you traverse the outskirts of the city, the skyline dominated by skeletal structures and crumbling buildings, a lone house nestled on the periphery catches your eye. 
Its presence amidst the urban decay is a stark contrast, a beacon of intrigue amid the desolation.

    Approaching cautiously, you navigate through the debris-strewn streets, your senses attuned to the slightest hint of danger. 
    The house stands as a silent sentinel, its weathered fa√ßade bearing witness to the ravages of time. 
    With each step closer, the weight of history presses down upon you, a palpable reminder of the world that once thrived within these walls.
    <br /><br />
    Entering the abandoned dwelling, a sense of unease settles over you like a shroud. The interior is cloaked in darkness, broken only by shafts of light filtering through cracks in the decaying roof. 
    The air is thick with the scent of mildew and decay, a testament to years of neglect.

    Suddenly, a shuffling sound echoes from the shadows, and you tense, instinctively reaching for your weapon. From the darkness emerge two scavengers, their ragged appearance a testament to their struggle for survival. With a mixture of fear and desperation in their eyes, they brandish makeshift weapons, ready to defend their territory.
    <br /><br />
    Heart pounding, you brace yourself for the confrontation, adrenaline coursing through your veins. With practiced precision, you engage in a deadly dance, each movement calculated to evade the scavengers' vicious onslaught. The battle is fierce and unforgiving, the air thick with the clang of metal and the scent of blood.
