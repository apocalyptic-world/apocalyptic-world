    As you make your way through an area of the wilderness you hear the faint sounds of
    flowing water. Moving closer you come upon a waterfall.<br/>
    The kind of waterfall that isn't complete without a water nymph bathing. Is there one?
    <br /><br />
    With a sense of déjà vu you remember another waterfall with a girl as bait to draw you in and then the ambush...<br/>
    <<if $player.stats.waterfall.wins>>
        ... And the win.
    <<elseif $player.stats.waterfall.tricked || $player.stats.waterfall.losts>>
        ... And the bumps on the head and being plundered.

    <br /><br />
    You draw closer to the waterfall. Unfortunately nobody is home.
    <br /><br />
    At least there seems to be fish in the little creek that runs off the pond from under the waterfall. Perhaps not a wasted exploration.
    <br /><br />
    <<linkreplace 'Go fishing'>>
        You <<=setup.companions.count() ? 'and your companions ' : ''>> decide to fish with make-shift rods.
        <br /><br />
        Success - of sorts! The world ended but plastic remains forever? You hook <strong class="iitem">5 plastic</strong> but no fish.
