<h1 class="ptitle">CITY</h1>
<br /><br />

You decide to investigate what's happening in one of the corners of the destroyed city. After walking around desolated city for a couple of hours, you don't spot a single living soul. Eventually you find and decide to approach a burnt-out car that from a distance reminded you of a police car. And so it is.

	Your companion <<=setup.displayName(_mechanic)>>, the group's mechanic, steps forward, eyes already scanning the vehicle.

		Give me a sec... Might be able to salvage a part or two.

	While <<=setup.displayName(_mechanic)>> ducks under the hood with a quiet hum of approval, you begin checking the interior.

			No luck. Everythingâ€™s either stripped or corroded beyond use. Damn shame.

	The car is partially destroyed. You try to open the trunk of the vehicle but are met with no initial success. 
	<br />
	You try a few more times, and actually manage to successfully open the back of the trunk, seeing a <strong>gas can</strong> within.

	<strong>You picked up a gas can.</strong>

	<<pickup $backpack 'blueprint_crossbow' 1>>
<<else>>
	The car is completely destroyed, most likely from the shockwave of a bomb explosion. 
	<br /> 
	However, your attention is drawn to a cardboard box with glinting pieces of metal tucked away in a nearby sewer hole.
	<br /><br />
	You reach out your hand and grab the cardboard box, pulling out the strange objects. But they're not so strange upon further examination.

	They are 0.38 caliber bullets.
