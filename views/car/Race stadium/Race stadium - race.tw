<h1 class="ptitle">RACE STADIUM</h1>
<br />
The race line is set. Four machines stand ready, each one more monstrous than the last, engines grumbling in anticipation, smoke curling up from cracked exhaust pipes. 
The scene is like something out of a nightmare—or a dream, depending on how you look at it.

The race is a death trap wrapped in glory. 
You’ve heard the stories: engines overheating mid-drift, spike traps in turn three, racers disappearing in the tunnels under lap two. 
Hell, some say the Syndicate rigs the whole thing just to see who’s desperate enough to survive it.
