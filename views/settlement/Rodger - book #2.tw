You started your journey together with Eve. She suggested that you walk along the railway track. You kept walking for few hours before you reached destroyed train station.

		Why you're so interested in my past?<br />
		I lived in a place called <strong class="iitem">The Sanctuary</strong>. At that time I was young and I thought that's what I wanted. Later it changed when I escaped and met Rodger. He helped me a lot. Life is much simplier with him, maybe even too much.

	She understood she said too much and turned away and kept walking.
