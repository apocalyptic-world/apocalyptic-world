At a fast pace, you ride on horseback through the forest and soon reach Roger's settlement. How comfortable it is to have a horse...
<br /><br />
<<rodger>>
	<<= $player.name>>! You got it! I never doubted you.
<</rodger>>
<br /><br />
You slowly dismount from the horse and tell him thanks.

<br /><br />
You tell Roger that Harper wanted more than you gave him, and Rodger will remain indebted to you.

			What? Why? Well, we can't blame you... Everything happens as it must. Eve and the settlers will be somewhat disappointed to hear this.
		<</rodger>>
		<br /><br />
		Roger turns around and slowly walks away while you turn towards the horse and look at him with a smile on your face. In that moment, you realize that you don't even know his name and decide to come up with a name for him yourself.
		<br /><br />
		What you will call your horse? <<textbox "_tmpHorseName" 'Bullet'>>
		<br /><br />
		While you're patting a horse a settlement girl comes to you from behind and taps on your shoulder.
		<br /><br />

			Oh my god! A horse! Please, please take me for a ride.
