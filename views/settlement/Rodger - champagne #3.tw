You cautiously enter and slowly begin to look around.

Roger mentioned some secret doors to the basement, but you couldn't find them. As you continued to wander around the first floor, your foot sank into the floor. As a precaution, you tapped your foot on the floor a few more times, and the hole became even bigger. It was big enough for a person to climb through. Nearby, you found some old metal stairs, which you placed in the hole leading down to the basement.

Downstairs was dark and damp. Mold was everywhere and you had trouble seeing where you were even walking. After a moment, you heard the sound of a glass bottle breaking. Looking down next to you, you noticed many champagne bottles and two wine bottles.

A moment after collecting the bottles, suddenly you hear the sound of many people upstairs. They are making a lot of noise and causing a commotion, and one of them shouts, "I saw someone come in here!

  <br /><br />
  	Eve also hears something upstairs. And just as she tries to tell you, you forcefully put your hand over her mouth and press her against the wall.

The sound of people from upstairs continues for a while, and after some time, when they give up their search, it can be heard that they have decided to stay overnight on the first floor.

	Cautiously and quietly climbing up the stairs, you see at least 2 men and 1 woman.
