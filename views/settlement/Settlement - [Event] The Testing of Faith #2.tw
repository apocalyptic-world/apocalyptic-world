        You managed to escape when they almost got you. Together with Rodger you run away.
        <br /><br />
    <</if>>
    With a heavy heart, you and the priest turned away from the camp, leaving the blocked stream behind. The journey back to the settlement was a somber one, the silence punctuated only by the crunch of gravel underfoot.
    <br /><br />
    When you arrived, the news was met with a mixture of disappointment and understanding. 
    Eve, though visibly disheartened, offered a supportive smile.
    <br /><br />
    <<eve>>
        You did what you thought was best. We'll find another way.

        <<set $player.money += 500>>
    <</if>>
    Exhausted but triumphant, you and the Rodger returned to the settlement, the sound of the flowing stream echoing in your ears. The village was still and quiet, the anticipation palpable. 
    When you arrived, Eve rushed to greet you, her eyes shining with gratitude.
    <br /><br />
    <<eve>>
        Oh, thank you, thank you!
    <</eve>>
    <br />
    Rodger smiled, relief washing over him.
    <br /><br />
    <<rodger>>
        It was a hard-fought battle, but we did it. Our people will have water once more.
    <</rodger>>
    <br />
    As you all waited for the water to reach the settlement, the priest's wife turned to you, her face lit up with a newfound hope. 
    <br /><br />
    <<eve>>
        You know. it's been so long since I've had a real shower. Do you have one?
    <</eve>>
    <br />
    Surprised but understanding her longing for a simple luxury, you nodded.
    <br /><br />
    <<rodger>>
        I'll stay. Just to make sure everything's alright.
    <</rodger>>
    <br />
    <<eve>>
        Thank you, my love. I'll be back soon.
    <</eve>>
    <br />

        As you entered your shelter, a modest refuge in this harsh world, the Eve looked around with a mixture of curiosity and appreciation. 
        The dim light filtered through a small, dusty window, casting a gentle glow on the weathered walls.
        <br />
        You went inside wood cabin and you showed her where shower is.
        <br />
        She smiled warmly, gratitude gleaming in her eyes.
        <br /><br />
        <<eve>>
            It's more than I could have hoped for. Thank you, truly.
        <</eve>>
        <br /><br />
        With a final nod, you left her to her privacy, retreating to a small adjoining room to give her space. The minutes stretched on, the only sound in the room being the steady flow of water.
        <br /><br />

                <<you>>
                    Would you mind if I joined you? It's been so long since any of us had a chance for a proper shower.
                <</you>>
                <br /><br />
                There was a pause, and then a soft chuckle.
                <br /><br />
                <<eve>>
                    Of course, you're welcome to join. It's a small space, but we'll make it work.
                <</eve>>
                <br /><br />
                With a feeling of both gratitude and anticipation, you pulled back the curtain and stepped into the shower area. 
                <br /><br />
                <<video 'settlement/eve_shower1'>>
                <br /><br />
                You grabbed a sponge and started to wash her back as warm water enveloped you both, washing away the grime and weariness of the world outside.
                <br />
                As you did that your dick rubbed againt her ass and it slowly got hard - she noticed it and tried to press her ass as if unintentionally against it few more times.
                <br /><br />

                    <br /><br />
                    Inch a bit closer and gently urge her to lean forward more. Then you grab your hard dick and slide it slowly into her pussy. She instantly moans as Rodger hasn't given her pleasure a very long time. 
                    <br />
                    She adjusts her position and slowly speeds up, letting you just enjoy warm shower and her tight pussy.
                    <br /><br />
                    <<eve>>
                        Harder... Harder!

                        <br /><br />
                        You grab her waist and hold to it as you thrust your hard dick stronger and deeper inside her pussy. She instantly lets out big moan and even helps with her movements, not letting the phase change or stop.
                        <br /><br />

                            With a deep breath, you press your forehead against the wall, savoring a relaxing chuckle, enjoying the moment for a while.

                The curtain rustled gently as Eve emerged from the shower, her hair slightly damp and a serene glow on her face.
                <br />
                She offered a grateful smile, a silent thank you for the small but meaningful reprieve as her towel slipped and her breast flashed.
