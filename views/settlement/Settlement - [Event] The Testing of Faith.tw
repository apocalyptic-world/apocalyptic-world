<<set $prevFight = null>>
Approaching the village, you notice that a large portion of its inhabitants are gathered by the church, with Roger standing among them. It seems that a rather loud argument has erupted in their midst. You decide to get closer and find out what exactly has transpired.
<br /><br />
 <<rodger>>
    We find ourselves at a crossroads. The arrival of these newcomers challenges us, tests our faith. But remember, it is through compassion and trust that we've built this settlement.
 <</rodger>>
 <br /><br />
 <<newgirl>>
 <<sayNpc $tmpGirl>>
    Rodger speaks true. We cannot abandon the very principles that brought us together in the first place. We must help them.
 <</sayNpc>>
 <br />
<<newguy>>
 <<sayNpc $tmpGuy>>
    Pastor, with all due respect, we've been lucky so far. But how long can we rely on luck alone? We need to be practical, to protect what we've built.
 <</sayNpc>>
 <br /><br />
 While people argue among themselves, and it seems that a large part is against Roger, you notice that Eve isn't even standing next to him, but rather, 
 she positions herself between the church doors, watching what's happening with a slight squint in one eye. Your gazes meet, and she closes the doors from the inside.
 <br /><br />
 <div id="option_inside">

        <br /><br />
        <<set _inside = true>>
        <<run $('#option_listen').hide()>>
        You walk past the crowd, and it seems like no one notices you. Slowly, you open the door and see Eve sitting there with book in her hands. 
        She appears slightly bewildered, but still greets you. She continues to sit in the corner on the bench.
        <br /><br />
        <<you>>
            What's happening out there?
        <</you>>
        <br /><br />
        <<eve>>
            Ah... We managed to find a dried-up riverbed that runs right past our village, so we decided to see what really happened with it. We went up the stream and spotted some sort of bandit camp there, they've just barricaded it shut.
        <</eve>>
        <br /><br />
        <<eve>>
            Rodger tried to talk to them, but he barely made it out of there alive... Now the others are trying to convince him that we should still do something about it for the greater good.
        <</eve>>
        <br /><br />
        <<you>>
            And what do you think about that?
        <</you>>
        <br /><br />
        A tomb-like silence ensues. She doesn't answer for a moment, but simply looks at the wooden cross on the wall of the church.
        <br /><br />
        <<eve>>
            No matter how much I love him and am grateful to him... I'm tired of all this. We can't even properly wash ourselves, and all Rodgers can say about it is that we have to have faith...
        <</eve>>
        <br /><br />
        She puts her hand between your legs and massages your bulge right before she pulls your dick out.
        <br /><br />
        <<eve>>
            I just want the opportunity to properly wash up once. That water would really help us
        <</eve>>
        <br /><br />
        <<video 'settlement/faith1'>>
        <br /><br />
        Unexpectedly, she leans over you and puts your dick in her mouth and passionately starts to suck it. Every now and then she helps her mouth with her hand by jerking you off a bit...
        <br /><br />
        Then a loud creak is heard, and the door opens. Rodger comes and but doesn't notice Eve between your legs. She stays there as he asks you to come with him. 
        <br /><br />

            There are dangers, yes. But faith without action can be as empty as action without faith. Perhaps we can take precautions and trust that the higher power will guide our efforts.
        <</sayNpc>>
        <br />
        <<newguy>>
        <<sayNpc $tmpGuy>>
            It's a gamble, no doubt. But if we succeed, the rewards could be immense. More resources, better chances of survival.
        <</sayNpc>>
        <br /><br />
        <<rodger>>
            Sorry, but we can't do that. 
        <</rodger>>
        <br /><br />
        Finally, Roger notices that you are here and calls out to you.

        What do you think about that? What should I do?

    <br /><br />
    <<linkreplace 'Tell that you will go and talk with them'>>
        <<rodger>>
            I'm sorry, but I know your talking. It's better if you leave it to me.
        <</rodger>>
        <br /><br />
        <<linkreplace 'Insist'>>
            <<rodger>>
                Ah.. Alright. But I'll go with you.
            <</rodger>>
            <br /><br />
            <<linkreplace 'Go to the camp'>>
                The sun hung low in the sky, casting long, ominous shadows across the desolate landscape. You and the priest, clad in tattered robes, 
                cautiously approached the blocked water stream, your hearts heavy with the burden of your mission. 
                This water source was crucial for Rodger's settlement's survival, and you couldn't afford to fail.
                <br />
                As you drew nearer, the sharp crackle of a campfire echoed through the barren wasteland. 
                Hidden behind the remnants of a shattered trees, you beheld a bandit camp, a motley assortment of makeshift tents and scavenged weaponry.
                <br />
                The leader, a burly figure with a cruel glint in his eye, stepped forward, his lips curling into a sneer.
                <br /><br />
                <<newguy>>
                <<sayNpc $tmpGuy>>
                    Well, well, what have we here? Holy men, come to beg for a sip of water?
                <</sayNpc>>
                <br /><br />
                Rodger, a man of weathered faith, held his ground, his voice steady.
                <br /><br />
                <<rodger>>
                    We seek only what is rightfully ours, friend. The stream you've blocked is meant to flow freely for all who need it.
                <</rodger>>
                <br />
                A harsh, mocking laugh rang out from the bandit leader.
                <br /><br />
                <<sayNpc $tmpGuy>>
                    Rights? There's no such thing in this world, padre. It's what you can take that matters.
                <</sayNpc>>
                <br /><br />
                Undeterred, Rodger continued.
                <br /><br />
                <<rodger>>
                    I implore you, let us pass. Our settlement is in dire need. We can find another way to resolve this.
                <</rodger>>
                <br />
                <<sayNpc $tmpGuy>>
                    Resolve, eh? I've got a resolution for you. Leave, now, before my patience runs out.
                <</sayNpc>>
                <br /><br />
                <<if $player.money >= 500>>
                    <div id="option_money">
                        <<linkreplace 'Offer them 500 caps'>>

                            <<set $player.money -= 500>>
                            The bandits' leader, a gruff and weathered figure, took the caps from your outstretched hand with a sly grin.
                            <br />
                            As he pocketed the caps, the bandits started to disperse, chatting and laughing among themselves, paying you no heed. 
                            Confused and growing frustrated, you cleared your throat, trying to regain their attention.
                            <br /><br />
                            <<you>>
                                So, about unblocking the stream... We gave you the caps, now fulfill your end of the deal.
                            <</you>>
                            <br />
                            The bandit exchanged a knowing glance with his comrades before bursting into laughter.
                            <br />
