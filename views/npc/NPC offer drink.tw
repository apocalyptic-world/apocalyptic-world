<<set _himOrHer = setup.pronounceWho($tmpGirl)>>

 The <<=setup.displayName($tmpGirl)>>'s gaze flickers to the bottle as you approach, curiosity sparking in <<=_hisOrHer>> eyes. 
 Without a word, you offer <<=_himOrHer>> a glass, the bubbles dancing in the dim light of a flickering street lamp.
 <br /><br />
<<set $tmpGirl.quests.lastInteractionDay = $game.day>>
<<if $tmpGirl.pregnancy > 10 && setup.percentageChance(50)>>
    <<sayNpc $tmpGirl>>
        I will have to decline as I am pregnant. I really don't want to hurt the baby.
    <</sayNpc>>
    <br />
<<else>>
    <<=setup.pronounceWhos($tmpGirl, true)>> initial surprise gives way to a cautious smile as <<=_heOrShe>> accepts the glass, the effervescence of the champagne a stark contrast to the harsh realities of their world.
    <<=setup.pronounceWhos($tmpGirl, true)>> raises bottle of champagne.
    <br /><br />
    <<sayNpc $tmpGirl>>
        A taste of luxury in the midst of chaos
    <</sayNpc>>

    Sitting together on the bench, surrounded by the sounds of the settlement's inhabitants going about their daily routines, you share stories of survival and moments of fleeting joy. 
    The champagne serves as a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there are still moments worth savoring, connections worth forging.
    <br /><br />
    As the time deepens and the stars twinkle faintly through the haze of pollution, the <<=setup.displayName($tmpGirl)>> continues to drink, indulging in the rare luxury. 
    <<=setup.pronounceWhos($tmpGirl, true)>> speech becomes slurred, and laughter spills out uncontrollably. 
    It's evident <<=_heOrShe>>'s become quite drunk, <<=_himOrHer>> guard lowered as <<=_heOrShe>> shares tales of <<=_hisOrHer>> past with increasing openness and sentimentality.
    <br /><br />
    Eventually, as the champagne runs dry, <<=_heOrShe>> leans heavily on your shoulder, <<=_hisOrHer>> words now a jumble of gratitude and nostalgia for a world long lost.
    <br /><br />
    <<run setup.cabinInventory.drop('champagne', 1)>>
    <<sayNpc $tmpGirl>>
        Wow! I am really drunk... Thank god the bottle is empty as I couldn't stop..
    <</sayNpc>>
    <br />
    <strong>You both are drunk!</strong>
